This error means that `pytest` is **not installed** in your GitHub Actions environment, even though your workflow tries to run it.

### **Why?**
- Your workflow runs:  
  `pip install .[test]`
- But your `pyproject.toml` (and/or `setup.py`) does **not** define a `test` extra, so `pytest` is not installed.

---

## **How to Fix**

### 1. **Add test dependencies to `pyproject.toml`**

Add this section to your `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
    "pytest",
    "httpx"
]
```
Add any other test dependencies you use (e.g., `pytest-cov`, etc.).

---

### 2. **(Optional) Add to `setup.py` for legacy support**
If you want to support `pip install .[test]` for both modern and legacy setups, add:
```python
extras_require={
    "test": [
        "pytest",
        "httpx"
    ]
}
```
to your `setup()` call in `setup.py`.

---

### 3. **Commit and Push**
- Commit the changes to `pyproject.toml` (and `setup.py` if you add it).
- Push to GitHub.
- Your CI will now install `pytest` and the error will be resolved.
